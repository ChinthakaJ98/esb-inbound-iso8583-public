# ISO8583 Inbound Endpoint

The ISO8583 inbound endpoint supported via the ESB Profile of WSO2 Enterprise Integrator (WSO2 EI) is a listening inbound endpoint that can consume ISO8583 standard messages.
ISO8583 is an international messaging standard for financial transaction card originated messages, and is commonly used in transactions between devices such as point-of-sale(POS) terminals and automated teller machines(ATMs).
Although there are various versions of the ISO8583 standard, the ISO8583 inbound endpoint is developed based on the 1987 version. For more information on the ISO8583 standard, see [ISO8583 Documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8583).

## Getting started
To get started, go to [Configuring ISO8583 Inbound Endpoint Operations](config.md). Once you configure the ISO8583 inbound endpoint, the ESB Profile of WSO2 WSO2 EI can consume ISO8583 messages.
